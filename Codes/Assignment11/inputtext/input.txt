Global Innovation Network and Analysis (GINA) team is a group of senior technologists located in centers of excellence (COEs) around the world.
The teamâ€™s charter is to engage employees across global COEs to drive innovation, research and university partnerships.
The GINA case study provides an example of how a team applied the Data Analytics Lifecycle to analyze innovation data t EMC.
Innovation is typically a difficult concept to measure, and this team wanted to look for ways to use advanced analytical methods to identify key innovators within the company.
The GINA team thought its approach would provide a means to share ideas globally and increase knowledge sharing among GINA members who may be separated geographically.
